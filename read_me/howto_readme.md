# Guide for creating README.txt (Codebook)

README.txt files, sometimes referred to as codebooks, provide the necessary information, or metadata, needed to make digital assets (numerical data, photographs, spread sheets, movies) add value and make working with these data easier and accessible to others. This document will help serve as a guide as to what should and can be included in a well-formed codebook.

### Best Practices


**Create one readme file for each data file, whenever possible.** It is also appropriate to describe a “dataset” that has multiple, related, identically formatted files, or files that are logically grouped together for use (e.g. a collection of Matlab scripts). When appropriate, also describe the file structure that holds the related data files. See Example 2 for describing grouped or multiple files.

**Name the readme so that it is easily associated with the data file(s) it describes.**

**Write your readme document as a plain text file,** avoiding proprietary formats such as MS Word whenever possible.1 Format the readme document so it is easy to understand (e.g. separate important pieces of information with blank lines, rather than having all the information in one long paragraph).

**Format multiple readme files identically.** Present the information in the same order, using the same terminology.

**Use standardized date formats.** Suggested format: [W3C/ISO 8601 date standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime), which specifies the international standard notation of YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDThhmmss.

**Follow the scientific conventions of your discipline for taxonomic, geospatial and geologic names and keywords.** Whenever possible, use terms from standardized taxonomies and vocabularies, a few of which are listed below.

### Recommended Content
Recommended minimum content for data re-use is in <b>bold</b>.

1. *Introductory information*

	* **For each filename, a short description of what data it contains**

	* Format of the file if not obvious from the file name

	* If the data set includes multiple files that relate to each other, the relationship between the files or a description of the file structure that holds them (possible terminology might include “dataset” or “study” or “data package”)

	* **Name/institution/address/email information for**

		* **Principle investigator (or person responsible for collecting the data)**

		* Associate or co-investigators

		* Contact person for questions

	* **Date of data collection (can be a single date, or a range)**

	* **Information about geographic location of data collection**

	* **Date that the file was created**

	* Date(s) that the file(s) was updated and the nature of the update(s), if applicable

	* Keywords used to describe the data topic

	* Language information

1. *Methodological information*

	* **Method description, links or references to publications or other documentation containing experimental design or protocols used in data collection**

	* Any instrument-specific information needed to understand or interpret the data

	* Standards and calibration information, if appropriate

	* Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data

	* Definitions of codes or symbols used to note or characterize low quality/questionable/outliers that people should be aware

	* People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission

1. *Data specific information*

	* **Full names and definitions (spell out abbreviated words) of column headings for tabular data**

	* **Units of measurement**

	* **Definitions for codes or symbols used to record missing data**

	* **Specialized formats or abbreviations used**

1. *Sharing and Access information*

	* Licenses or restrictions placed on the data2

	* Links to publications that cite or use the data

	* Links to other publicly accessible locations of the data

	* **Recommended citation for the data**

	* Information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data
