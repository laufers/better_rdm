Data Filename: 		2002_NCAGL_Inventory.txt

Data File Description: 
	These data were collected as part of the Northern California Grasslands (NCAGL) diversity research program. Data collected include species richness, presence absence of plant species, peak standing biomass and nitrogen and phosphorus soil content. The relationship between diversity and productivity can take many different shapes. Soil nutrients can affect species composition, diversity and productivity. This research program will attempt to investigate soil nutrients to as a possible factor in determining the shape of the diversity productivity curve.

Data Collection Dates: 
	20020530 - 20020601

Geographic Coverage: 
	Data were collected in the coastal mountains of Northern California, in the Valley Oak Reserve. The Valley Oak Reserve is adjacent to and managed by Northern California University (NCU). NCU is located in University Town in Sonoma County, approximately 150 km northeast of San Francisco. Bounding coordinates are West: -120°15'00", East: -120°30'00", North: -39°15'00", South: 38°45'00". Exact locations of sites and plots are available upon request.

Methodological Information:

Methods: 
	Twenty five 1 m^2 plots were randomly placed throughout the Valley Oak Reserve. Due to destructive biomass harvest, plots are relocated each year. Two plastic sample bags (Ziplock) are labeled with the randomly assigned plot number and contents (plant or soil). If more than one bag is needed, all bags are labeled with the contents, plot number and bag number (i.e. the second of four bags of plant clippings from plot 6 will be labeled "Plant, Plot 6, Bag 2/4").
	
	At each plot, one person, starting at the south-east corner of the plot, identifies each plant according to the Jepson manual. Species names are recorded in the field notebook.
	
	Species names are used to calculate species richness per plot.
	
	All plant material within each 1 m^2 plot is clipped at soil level and placed in the sample bag. Sample bags containing plant matter are brought to the laboratory. If wet, plant matter is dried using paper towels. Plant material is dried in a drying oven at 80 degrees C for 24 (+/-2) hours. Plant matter is weighed within 2 hours of drying.
	
	Approximately 0.5 g of soil, free from plant debris, is collected from the middle of the plot. Soil is placed in appropriate sample bag. Soil samples are placed into aluminum sample trays and placed into a drying oven and dried at 80 degrees C for 24 (+/- 2) hours. Soil is ground using a ball mill until powdery and weighed. Soil sample is analyzed for Phosphorus and Nitrogen using a SoilPro v. 10 machine. Lower limits of detection for Phosphorus is 0.005 and for Nitrogen is 0.01. All procedures for this machine are followed.
	
Quality Assurance: 
	All sampling was done by Jane Researcher, Sally Labmanager and John Fieldassistant. Data was plotted and reviewed for data entry errors by a second lab member before submission.
